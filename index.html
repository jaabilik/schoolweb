        Boys Bring Back the Provincial Championship Banner, Girls Finish Fifth. The Lightning senior boys brought back the Provincial Championship banner for the first time since 2017 after finishing as the silver medalist at the last two AA provincial tournaments in 2021 and 2019. The LCS senior girls also put in a strong showing finishing fifth overall in a very tough competitive field. With a silver medal at junior boys and a strong fifth place finish at junior girls, 2022 was a very successful volleyball season for our program. </p>

    <p> If you happened to drive past Southridge Church last week, you may have witnessed an undertaking only possible through community-partnership and collaboration. The sanctuary was transformed as over 50,000 pounds of food and hundreds of volunteers descended on the church to help pack hampers for the people of Lytton. Among these community volunteers were two-hundred high school students from Langley Christian School (LCS). </p>

          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> I have been rooted in this school for much of my life.  My first school experience as a child was at Richmond Christian Elementary until my family moved to Langley in the fall of my Grade 6 year.  I attended this school as a student in Grades 6 and 7, when that was the highest grade level we had.  My mom volunteered here, spending endless hours in the library and classrooms as well as serving on the Education Committee that worked so hard in developing our middle and high schools. My dad bid ridiculous amounts of money on cheese at the auction and, despite the protests of my brothers and I, signed us up to run the fish pond game at the auction just about every year.  My younger brother was in the very first graduating class of LCS!  My time at LCS continued after I completed my teaching degree and I’ve now taught for 14 years at LCS; both of my sons have attended here since kindergarten (and now just finished grades eight and ten!). It was never really my plan to become a teacher – I had a detailed plan of becoming a psychologist. It was interesting to discover how my plans and God’s plans don’t always mesh together! He worked in my heart and drew me to where He was calling me to be.  The first time, and every time since, that I stepped in front of a classroom and worked with students, I knew in my heart that this was what I was created to do. </p>
